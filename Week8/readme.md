# Week 8

开放式命题，很烦。

花了近一天把W3Shools的HTML、CSS和JS教程简单看了一遍，又看了看bootstrap和W3.CSS的教程。前端的内容实在庞杂，差点给我劝退。

最后给自己的资源站简单做了个主页和导航栏。项目成型后会上传并在此附上链接。


Open-ended problems are annoying.

Took quite a whole day skimming through the HTML, CSS and JS tutorials on W3Shools, and also read about the tutorials of bootstrap and W3.CSS. Front-end stuff is complicated.

Made a homepage and a navbar for my resource station. Might share the project after completion.
