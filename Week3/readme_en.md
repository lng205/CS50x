# Week 3

Plurality properly introduced the concept of voting.

As a student unfamiliar with voting, Tideman's principle is interesting.

As a student unfamiliar with data structure, the 2-D data structure like matrix and graph, along with the adjacency matrix is interesting.

Besides the comprehension of the problem's description and the coding framework, the hardest part of the code should be judging whether there's a loop in the graph. This is a brilliant application of the recursive thinking taught. The guidance from lectures and problem is perfect, which make this problem a **great** one in the course.

Code thoughts: To find whether there's a route from a node to a given node, one can search every next node current node pointing to, and recurse until an end node or finding the route.
