readability的三个函数遍历了三遍文本，这是效率较低的地方。但代码模板给定了三个函数的框架，应该是为了方便check50检查，同时写起来也更简单。

scrabble和substitution都有字符映射也即加解密的思想，有点意思。对有C基础的同学而言题目难度不大。

The three functions in readability walk through the text three times, resulting in inefficiency. But the framework was given three functions in it, probably for check50 and simpler design.
