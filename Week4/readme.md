# Week 4

filter和volume分别是图像和音频处理，之前用Matlab和FPGA做过许多类似的实验，原理很熟悉。

代码中有较多繁琐的设计，尚需优化。总觉得这次的麻烦作业是在为后续突出Python的优点做铺垫。

recover中数据恢复的原理挺有趣。

本作业涉及含多个C文件的项目，有助加深对库、链接和编译等概念的理解。


Filter and volume are image and audio processing respectively. Having done quite a few similar labs with Matlab and FPGA, I'm familiar with the principles.

There are lots of tedious repetitions in the code which may require some improvement. The cumbersome in this problem might be emphasizing the benefits of python.

Recover is an application of data recovery which is pretty interesting.

The problem set contains projects with multiple C files, helpful to deepen the understanding of library, linking and compiling.
